# Simple form

* The form should have 2 fields, _from_ and _to_
* When the user clicks on the labels, the corresponding field gets focus
* One button will submit the form
* The other button does not submit the form and clears it
* Both buttons have hover effects (color, background changes, cursor)
* The user cannot submit the form if there is no text entered in the input fields
* The page should be responsive with the items stacking on top of each other
* Improve text readability
